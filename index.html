            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Kyre Shamwell, a senior Computer Science major attending North Carolina
                Agricultural and Technical State University. I've had the opportunity to gain
                practical experience through a co-op and an internship with Collins Aerospace.
                During my co-op, I worked on the Digital Technology team, where I was responsible
                for migrating file shares to a new data security platform and helping resolve
                end-users' data security solution needs. My time at Collins Aerospace helped me
                develop several key skills, including teamwork, time management, and problem-solving.
                These skills were honed as I collaborated with various team members to resolve IT
                problems while balancing my full-time studies. In my software engineering internship,
                I worked on updating legacy Python 2 code. My task involved modifying the code so
                that tests, which were previously run on a GUI and pushed outputs, now run fully
                from the command line using Python 3. Additionally, I am actively involved in the
                National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the Association for Computing Machinery
                (ACM), where I engage with a network of professionals, participate in events and activities,
                and contribute to a community of computing enthusiasts. This experience and involvement have
                prepared me well for a future career in computer science and technology.
            </p>
