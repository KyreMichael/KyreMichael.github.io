            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Kyre Shamwell, a senior Computer Science major attending 
                North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I've 
                had the opportunity to gain practical experience through a co-op 
                and an internship with Collins Aerospace. During my co-op, I 
                worked on the Digital Technology team, where I was responsible 
                for migrating file shares to a new data security platform and helping 
                resolve end-users' data security solution needs. Working at Collins Aerospace 
                throughout 2023 helped me develop several key skills, including teamwork, 
                time management, and problem-solving. I honed these skills by collaborating 
                with various team members to resolve IT problems while balancing my full-time studies.
            </p>

            <p>During my software engineering internship, I was responsible for 
                migrating legacy Python 2 code to Python 3. This involved modifying 
                existing tests and implementing an HTML-based test output system, which 
                allowed tests to be run independently of a GUI. I also converted GUI-based 
                tests to Python 3, enabling them to be executed via the command line with 
                results logged to a text file. Additionally, I developed an HTML interface 
                using a Python localhost server to format and display test outputs with the 
                help of JavaScript. I tested the updated Python 3 scripts on Airborne Flight 
                Display (AFD) and Fomax devices to ensure their functionality and reliability. 
                To finalize the process, I committed the Python 3 modifications to GitLab using 
                a Linux server and documented all changes in AsciiDoc.
            </p>

            <p>Additionally, I am actively involved in the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) 
                and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), where I engage with a network of 
                professionals, participate in events and activities, and contribute to a community of 
                computing enthusiasts. This experience and involvement have prepared me well for a 
                future career in computer science and technology.
            </p>
