            <p>Hello, my name is Kyre Shamwell. I am a rising senior at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, majoring in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.2. I have made the Dean's List three times during my college tenure. I have been part of a co-op at Collins Aerospace from January 2023 to December 2023, working on the Digital Technology team, and I will return to Collins in the summer of 2024 for a Software Engineer internship.
            During my year at Collins, I developed skills in teamwork, time management, and problem-solving. These skills were honed as I collaborated with various teams to resolve IT problems while balancing my full-time studies. Additionally, I am actively involved in the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and I have participated in a hackathon.
            On the personal project front, I have built a gaming PC and worked on enhancing my technical portfolio by uploading assignments and projects. This hands-on experience has furthered my understanding of practical and theoretical computer science.
            </p>
